# reactive-spring-webflux
This is the code generated from the course: "Build Reactive MicroServices using Spring WebFlux/SpringBoot"

On this project , I learned about Reactive Webflux. 

There is 2 programming models for building RESTFUL APIs :
- Annotated Controllers
  - The popular way of building APIs on Spring.
- Functional Web
  - Uses the functional programming aspects like Lambdas, Method References, Functional Interfaces
  - It has 2 elements: the Router (where Rest endpoints are configured) & the Handler (Code to handle the request)
    - movies-review-service

On this Repo, there is the 2 ways. As well there is Junit Test cases and Integration Test cases to easily test the project and quickly detect issues when developing more features to the APIs.
